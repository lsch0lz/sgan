# Visualize the results of trained model

```python visualize.py --model_path path\to\your\model.pth```

The script will produce a ````.mp4```` and a ```.png``` file which contain the Ground Truth 
(Dashed line) and the prediction (Dotted Line).

You can modify those visualizations by changing line ```line 128``` in ```visualize.py```.
